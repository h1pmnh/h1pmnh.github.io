Summary Genesis Wallet was one of the harder web challenges in the 2022 Hack the Box (HTB) CTF. Our team composed of Synack Red Team members finished a respectable 21st place, unfortunately we were very close to solving this challenge and literally were about 5 minutes from a successful solve when time expired - so sad!
Personally I thought this was a very clever challenge and probably one of the best designed web challenges in any CTF I've done to date, so I thought I'd share it with interested readers.</description></item></channel></rss>
