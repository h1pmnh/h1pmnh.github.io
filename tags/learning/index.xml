In September 2022, I celebrated 2 years doing bug bounty as the anniversary of my first paid bounty on HackerOne passed. I thought it might be useful to write up some of the lessons learned and some tips and tricks that might help new hunters (things I wish I knew when I started). Bug bounty has been an incredible benefit in my life. It's allowed me the opportunity to achieve a lifestyle of continuous learning as well as transition to a full-time bug bounty career!</description></item></channel></rss>
