Summary This writeup talks about a successful collab that I did with Dark9T (@UsmanMansha) on a private program hosted on Bugcrowd. We ended up able to bypass Akamai WAF and achieve Remote Code Execution (P1) using Spring Expression Language injection on an application running Spring Boot. This was the 2nd RCE via SSTI we found on this program, after the 1st one, the program implemented a WAF which we were able to bypass in a different part of the application.</description></item></channel></rss>
