Summary In research related to a Synack Red Team client, I was able to discover several authentication bypass issues in the LuxCal web calendar component. The limited details of these issues, which have been resolved by the vendor in version 5.2.0 of the software, are listed below. As an agreement with the vendor, we are releasing very limited information on this bypass. This resulted in the assignment of 2 CVEs from MITRE.</description></item></channel></rss>
