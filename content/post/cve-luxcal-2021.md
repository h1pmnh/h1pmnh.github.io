## Summary
In research related to a Synack Red Team client, I was able to discover several authentication bypass issues in the LuxCal web calendar component. The limited details of these issues, which have been resolved by the vendor in version 5.2.0 of the software, are listed below. As an agreement with the vendor, we are releasing very limited information on this bypass. This resulted in the assignment of 2 CVEs from MITRE.

CVSS for both is `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` 9.8.

I'd like to thank the vendor for being extremely responsive to this issue!

### CVE 2021-45915
In LuxSoft LuxCal Web Calendar before 5.20, an unauthenticated attacker can mainipulate a cookie value. This allows the attacker's session to be authenticated as any registered LuxCal user, including the site administrator.
