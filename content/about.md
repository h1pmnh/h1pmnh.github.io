### Brief Bio
I'm a software developer, architect, author by trade, with years of experience in software large (millions of users) and small startups and non-profits. Recently I took a more active role in a life-long hobby of playing with security, cryptography, and puzzles into a full-on passion for security research, bug bounty, and the like.

### My Stats
I started bug bounty as a hobby in Sep 2020. I've hacked on 3 major platforms, my profiles are linked below:

 * [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/pmnh) - ~5400 rep, 7.0 signal, 24.0 impact
 * [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/pmnh) - ~650 pts, 100% accuracy, 15 P1s
 * [Synack (SRT)](https://acropolis.synack.com/inductees/pmnh/) - level 0x05, SRT of the Year 2023 (#1 SRT globally), Rookie of the Year 2023

I actively hunted on HackerOne from Sep 2020-Aug 2021. During this time, I was in the top 10 on the US leaderboard, delivering critical and high findings on numerous private and public programs. Towards the end of the year I moved to Bugcrowd, as well as joined the Synack Red Team (SRT).

My focus areas are deep recon / research and P1/P2/P3 findings. I'm always happy to discuss techniques around these or collaborate with hackers - ping me on Twitter ([@pmnh_](https://twitter.com/pmnh_)) or Discord (`pmnh#8207`). I haven't ever intentionally filed a P4/P5, so I can't really help you with questions about this class of bugs.

### Why Read This Site?
This simple site captures some stories and learnings on this journey. I hope you find it useful. I aim to publish once or twice monthly. My goal is to share interesting findings as well as some metrics and learnings as a relative newcomer to this field.

This site is *not* intended for people new to bug bounty, but instead targeting those looking to improve their craft, read more technical articles, and generally "talk shop". In most cases I won't be explaining commonly Google-able terms and suggest you rely on the many great resources around the web for bug bounty basics.

### How Do You Pronounce `pmnh`?
You can simply say each letter :smile:

### Feedback / Questions?
Feel free to send any feebdack my way on Twitter, I can be reached at [@pmnh_](https://twitter.com/pmnh_) - unfortunately my social media presence doesn't match my bug bounty platform names, sorry for any confusion :smile:
